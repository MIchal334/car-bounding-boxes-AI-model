# Car bounding boxes

## Overview

This project demonstrates a simple codebase for training a machine learning model to detect cars in images and output bounding boxes around them. The model is built using Keras, and it is trained on a dataset of images to learn to predict the coordinates of the bounding boxes that encompass the cars in each image.


## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Framework**: Keras (with TensorFlow backend)
- **Machine Learning**: Neural Networks for object detection and localization
